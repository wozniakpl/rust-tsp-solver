# Rust TSP solver

This repo is my approach to learning rust combined with the nostalgia of solving the travelling salesman problem for the "Data Structures and Computational Complexity" course.
## Getting started
- Install rust
- Compile the release version of the project

```sh
cargo build --release
```

- Test the program

```sh
./target/release/tsp
```

## Dev

Running the tests:

```sh
cargo test
```

Running the app:

```sh
cargo run
```
